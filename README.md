# Technologies well-suited to solve the challenges
Spark - batch process reddit dataset to generate term-frequency table for every word and every subreddit.

Spark Streaming - stream process the twitter message and classify.

Kafka - handle the twitter streaming messages.

Cassandra - a database with high availability for Spark Streaming to query the term-frequency table and class.

# The primary engineering challenges
Streaming process tiwtter message at the rate of 1000/sec. Classify every tweet into over 34,000 subreddit topics.
